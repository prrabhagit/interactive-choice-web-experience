# Interactive Choice Web Experience

A small front-end project that demonstrates DOM manipulation, animation, and user interaction using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The page presents a simple choice interface where user actions trigger dynamic visual responses such as floating elements, motion effects, and a celebration overlay.

## Features

- Animated background and floating decorations
- Interactive buttons with dynamic movement
- DOM-based visual effects
- Canvas confetti animation
- Optional background audio
- Responsive centered layout

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (animations, gradients, flexbox)
- JavaScript (DOM control, events, canvas)

## How It Works

The interface contains two primary actions.  
Positive confirmation activates a full-screen celebration with animated particles and falling elements, while the alternate option avoids selection by repositioning itself dynamically.

This project focuses on:
- event handling
- element positioning
- animation timing
- canvas rendering

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser

No dependencies or build tools required.

## Customization

You can easily modify:
- texts and labels
- animation intensity
- number of particles
- color palette
- background music by adding a file to `MUSIC_URL`

## Learning Purpose

This project is ideal for beginners exploring:
- JavaScript interactivity
- creative UI behavior
- browser-based animations

## License

Open for learning and modification.
